# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)

- Add `parse_calendar(String)` as the lossless whole-document entry point.
- Keep the root package focused on complete parsing, recurrence, and
  serialization workflows. Import low-level APIs directly from `ical/text`,
  `ical/model`, `ical/serialize`, or `ical/caldav`.
- Index recurrence overrides and exclusions once during `expand_series`.
- Use zero-copy XML views and indexed href selection for CalDAV multiget.
- Use `StringView` through the shared iCalendar unfolding and content-line
  parser, materializing strings only at model ownership boundaries.

## 0.1.0

- Initial iCalendar library and minimal CalDAV server release.
